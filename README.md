## Installation

Begin by installing the package through Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
$ composer require themsaid/laravel-langman-gui
```

Once done, add the following line in your providers array of `config/app.php`:

```php
Themsaid\LangmanGUI\LangmanServiceProvider::class
```

Then publish the configuration file:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Themsaid\LangmanGUI\LangmanServiceProvider"
```

## Usage

Once you have added the Service Provider point your browser to `http://project.dev/langman`, using this interface you'll be able to
browse translation keys in different languages, add/remove keys, scan your project files for missing translations, and finally save
your changes to the language JSON files.
