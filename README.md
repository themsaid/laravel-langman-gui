## Installation

Begin by installing the package through Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
$ composer require themsaid/laravel-langman-gui
```

If you're using Laravel 5.5 or higher the package will automatically register itself. If you're using Laravel 5.4 or lower, add the following line in your providers array of `config/app.php`:

```php
Themsaid\LangmanGUI\LangmanServiceProvider::class
```

Then publish the configuration file & assets:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider=Themsaid\\LangmanGUI\\LangmanServiceProvider
```

## Usage

Once you have added the Service Provider point your browser to `http://project.dev/langman`, using this interface you'll be able to
browse translation keys in different languages, add/remove keys, scan your project files for missing translations, and finally save
your changes to the language JSON files.

## Backup

Langman stores a backup of your entire `resources/lang` directory into `storage/langmanGUI`, you can use restore the original files
using this backup in case anything went wrong.
